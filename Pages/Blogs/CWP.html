                Article by Wajeeha Ashfaq Hamdani from Economics Wing, GAEE JMI
            </div>

            <div class="blog__item">
                Did you know that women with children tend to earn lower wages than women without children? This shortfall is known as the ‘child wage penalty’ or ‘family gap’ or ‘motherhood penalty’.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item">
                Mothers are given fewer wages than women without children, given that mothers are less dedicated to their job and can’t provide full attention as they have to take care of their children.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item">
                Interestingly the difference in the pay of mothers and non-mothers is much more than the wage difference of men and women.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item blog__bold">
                Research on child wage penalty shows that women receive a 4% pay cut or each child, while men receive a 6% pay increase.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                Mothers have to face discrimination in promotions, hiring and bonuses. They have to put up with worse job site evaluations indicating they are less credible or less involved in work than non-mothers.
            </div>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img class="blog_img" src="https://gaeejamia.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/snsfsf-5.jpg?w=768" alt="">
            </div>

            <div class="blog__item ">
                Even in today’s world, where we seem to have achieved equality, mothers still get less pay because they have children to look after.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                American economist Jane Waldfogel’s research showed that 40 to 50 per cent of the gender gap can be explained by the impact of parental and marital status on men’s and women’s earnings. (Source: Report by thirdway.org)
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                Another concept that is opposite to this is the <span class="blog__bold">Fatherhood Premium</span> in which fathers are given a rise when they have a child.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                The worst part of this is that the motherhood penalty or child wage penalty is more prominent in the blue-collar jobs or low pay jobs where the women cannot afford it the most.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                Some argue that the fact that mothers take long maternity leave or that they have to take fewer working hours than non-mothers to justify why they have a lower salary. Some even take a break from their job to nurture their children, and then they have
                to look for a new job all over again which also reduces their salary but this only constitutes roughly one-third of the child wage penalty.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                Research in the United States shows that changes in work behaviour and absenteeism can partly explain the child wage penalty. Research also shows that compared with men without children, only a small part of the father’s wage premium is due to a greater
                workload. This shows that cultural factors (negative perceptions of women’s responsibilities) play a role here and positive views of fathers in the workplace, probably associated with the traditionally male breadwinner role– are at play
                too.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item blog__bold">
                Therefore we need some solutions that can help correct the situation.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                One of the steps that can be taken is to promote EQUAL PARENTING.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                If both the mother and father take equal responsibility for their child, then there will be less pressure on the mother, and she can focus on work too.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                Childcare facilities at offices can also be a great help as this can create a balance. This will be relief to lactating mothers as well.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                Part-time and flexible job opportunities are required to make sure women can stay connected to the labour market.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                To conclude we can say that given support at homes and reducing discrimination at work places; the child wage penalty can be reduced to a great extent so the mothers won’t have to pay the penalty for a miraculous gift of nature.
