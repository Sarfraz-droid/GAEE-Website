                We gave Englishmen the ‘Kohinoor’, and they gave us ‘Tea’. The day is celebrated to bring out the global attention of governments to the impact of global tea on workers. It also highlights the effort of the people who are involved in the production of

                Since this wasn’t commercially feasible, British East India Company began to export opium from India to sell to the Chinese in exchange for silver, with which they would buy tea. So the British bought even more tea with their surplus of silver and sold
                the excess in India, which was a captive market at this point. This is how Indians got our chai.

                How tea cultivation started in India:
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                Commercial tea cultivation in India was driven by the British, who consumed tea in vast quantities, which they bought from China.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                Even though the British managed to countervail it with the opium trade, they found that their tea consumption was excessively expensive and unsustainable.
            </div>
            <div class="blog__item ">
                This realization led to a sustained effort by the British to understand tea production – and start tea cultivation in India.
            </div>

            <div class="blog__item ">
                In 1823, Scottish explorer Robert Bruce discovered a native tea plant growing in the Upper Brahmaputra Valley and being blended by the local Singhpho tribe. Maniram Dewan went on to become the first Indian to undertake private tea cultivation in Assam.

            <div class="blog__item ">
                The positive results of tea cultivation in Assam and Darjeeling stimulated many similar endeavours towards tea cultivations across the entire foothills of the Himalayas and other parts of India – such as Kumaon, DehraDun, Garhwal, Kangra Valley and Kulu
                in the north – and Nilgiri in the south.

                for tea is rushing the production process from farm to Market. In addition to experiencing drought, rising COVID cases in India and Nepal have impacted the tea harvest.
                <br><br> The demand of the ‘teafe’ (tea and café) culture and the introduction of new tea varieties have fuelled the growth of tea-based startups. Startups across the country are now bringing a variety to tea connoisseurs.
                <br><br>In India, tea consumption occupies more than 79-percent share in the non-alcoholic beverage market, and is valued at more than $30 billion.
